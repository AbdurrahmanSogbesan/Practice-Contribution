## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Contribute
<p>Follow this tutorial to contribute.</p>

## 1. Install git.
Git is a version control system that is used for tracking changes in a file. Git is an imporant tool we'll be using to work on our github projects. 
If you want to learn how to install git without any errors, follow this <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">tutorial</a>, if not, install it and move on to the next step.

## 2. Fork this repository.
Fork this repository using the fork button on the top right of this page, or the pencil icon on the right. 
This will create a copy with your name.

## 3. Clone your fork.
Cloning a project is simply taking that project and making a copy on your local machine. To clone this project, click the button on green that says `code` and on the drop down box, copy the URL of the project in the box, and open up your git bash terminal and type in the following command: `git clone <URL you just copied>`

It should look like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/Evavic44/Practice-Contribution.git 
```
which will clone the project in your local machine.

## 4. Switch directory
Next switch into the folder of the repo we just cloned by typing this command:
```
cd <repository name>
```
cd stands for "change directory" and the `<repository name>` is the name of the project repo. E.g **practice-contribution**

## 5. Point upstream branch to origin
```
git remote add upstream <URL of main repo>
```

We need to point our forked repo to the origin repo: where origin repo is the URL of the original repo we forked E.g `git remote add upstream https://github.com/CommunityPro/Practice-Contribution.git`

## 6. Create branch
In other to start making our changes, we need to create a new branch to work from.
```
git checkout -b <branch name>
```

You can name the branch anything you want, but for the sake of this project, name your branch `add-yourname` (replace yourname with your own name). E.g `git checkout -b add-bruce` 

## 7. Make your changes.
Copy the code below, edit it with your own information and then paste it into the <a href="https://github.com/CommunityPro/Practice-Contribution/edit/main/Contributors.md">Contributors</a> file of the **Practice Contribution** repo

```html

<!-- End of column-1 -->
```


### A few things to change:
- Replace the link with your own profile link 
```<a href="your link here"></a>```

- Right click on your github profile image and copy the image link and paste inside the `img` tag. Leave the `width=""` property

```html
<img src="your profile image link here" width="100px">
```

- Repalce the sub tag with your own name.

```html
<sub>Your Name</sub>
```

Then save your changes. 

## 8. Make a commit
Now we're done adding our profile, we need to make a commit to save that file added.
on the git bash terminal, type

```
git status
```
This will show us a list of all changes made.

Next do a git add .(period) which means, add every changes made.
```
git add .
```

<!--Screenshot of git add .-->

Now we can write our commit message.

```
git commit -m 'Add bruce wayne'
```

Change Bruce Wayne to your own name.

## 9. Push changes to GitHub
Now we have sucessfully added our profile, we can now push the changes to GitHub. Use the command below to do that.

```
git push origin <branch name>
```

Replace the <branch name> with the name of the branch you created earlier. E.g `git push origin add-bruce. 
  
Our changes should get pushed to the main repository and we can now do a pull request.
